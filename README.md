 Electric Vehicle Sales by State in India Analysis using python.
Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis in India
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across different states in India using Python. Through comprehensive data visualization and trend analysis, the goal is to understand regional EV adoption patterns, identify top-performing states, and uncover crucial insights that can support future infrastructure planning and policy decisions.

Objective
To analyze the growth and distribution of EV sales across various Indian states.

To identify key trends in EV adoption over time and across different vehicle categories.

To provide data-driven insights that can aid policymakers and urban planners in developing sustainable EV ecosystems.

Dataset Description
The analysis is based on a dataset containing the following features:

Year: The year in which the EV sale took place (e.g., 2019, 2023).

Month_Name: The name of the month during which the sale happened (e.g., Jan, Feb).

Date: The exact date of the sale record in DD/MM/YYYY format.

State: The name of the Indian state or Union Territory where the sale occurred.

Vehicle_Class: The specific class or model type of the vehicle (e.g., Motor Car, Bus).

Vehicle_Category: The broader category such as 2-Wheelers, 3-Wheelers, 4-Wheelers, Bus, or Others.

Vehicle_Type: Describes usage and type, like 2W_Personal, 4W_Shared, Bus, etc.

EV_Sales_Quantity: The number of electric vehicles sold in that particular entry.

Analysis and Key Insights
The project includes several analyses and visualizations, leading to the following insights:

Year-wise Trend: There has been a sharp rise in EV sales from 2021 to 2023, peaking in 2023, indicating strong recent growth in electric vehicle adoption. A notable drop was observed in 2024.

Top 10 States by EV Sales: Uttar Pradesh leads in total EV sales, followed by Maharashtra and Karnataka. This indicates strong EV adoption in the northern and western states of India.

Category-wise EV Sales: The majority of EV sales are dominated by 2-Wheelers and 3-Wheelers in the Indian electric vehicle market. 4-Wheelers, Buses, and other categories contribute comparatively very little.

Vehicle Type-wise EV Sales: 2W_Personal and 3W_Shared_Lowspeed are the most preferred EV types in India, showing that personal two-wheelers and shared low-speed three-wheelers have the highest adoption rates, while other vehicle types have much lower adoption.

EV Sales Forecast: The forecast, based on average past growth trends, suggests that EV sales may stabilize around 2025-2027, following the significant peak in 2023 and the sharp drop in 2024.
